      <p>
        I am a <span className="red-text">software engineer</span> at{" "}
        <span className="red-text">Google</span> with over ten years of{" "}
        <span className="orange-text">teaching</span> and collaborative work
        experience in academia. I earned my{" "}
        <span className="green-text">Ph.D.</span> in{" "}
        <span className="green-text">astrophysics</span> in 2022, and I have
        worked in the software industry ever since. My background in{" "}
        <span className="orange-text">mathematics</span> and computational
        techniques drives my interest in many of the personal software products
        I create.
