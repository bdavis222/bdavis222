      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer with over ten years of teaching and
        collaborative work experience in academia. I received my Ph.D. in
        astrophysics in 2022, and have worked in the software industry ever
        since. My background in mathematics and computational techniques drives
        my interest in many of the personal software products I create.
