        If you don't yet know how to program in any language, I have designed an{" "}
        <a href="/#/python" target="_blank">
          introductory Python course
        </a>{" "}
        (and a{" "}
        <a href="/#/python-course-mobile" target="_blank">
          mobile version
        </a>{" "}
        of the course as well) to bring you up to speed. If you already know how to 
        program in Python or any other language, you can skip to the next section.

        Note that a good understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) is
        essential to success in software engineering. If you do not have a solid
        grasp of OOP, please look over the lessons on{" "}
        <span className="green-text">classes</span> and{" "}
        <span className="green-text">inheritance</span> in the introductory
        Python course (and also do the corresponding tutorials).
