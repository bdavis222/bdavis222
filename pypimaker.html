      PyPI Maker is designed to simplify uploading Python packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI). 
      The program runs entirely within a window-based graphical user interface, 
      so as to not require any programming knowledge from the user in order to 
      upload their package and manage it on PyPI.
    </p>

      Donations are appreciated, but not required.

    <h2>
      Getting Started
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Dependencies
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a> 
        must be installed before PyPI Maker can be installed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Installation
    </h3>
    <p>
      To install PyPI Maker, open a terminal window and run the following command:
    </p>
    <code>
      pip install pypimaker
    </code>
    <p>
      <em>
        (Note that the <code>pip3</code> command may be required instead of <code>pip</code> 
        for some Python installations.)
      </em>
    </p>
    <h3>
      Generating Your PyPI Files
    </h3>
    <p>
      To generate the files needed for your PyPI package, run the following command:
    </p>
    <code>
      pypimaker generate
    </code>
    <p>
      This will launch a graphical user interface that looks like the following:
    </p>
    <a href="assets/images/pypimaker/0.png">
      <img class="bordered-image" src="assets/images/pypimaker/0.png" alt="Main GUI image" loading="lazy">
    </a>
    <p>
      Inputting the information for your project will generate all of the files needed for uploading it to PyPI 
      (<code>LICENSE</code>, <code>README.me</code>, <code>requirements.txt</code>, and <code>setup.py</code>). 
      This can be re-run at any time to re-generate these files.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Uploading Your Finished Project to PyPI
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you don't yet have an account on PyPI, <a href="https://pypi.org/account/register/">register for one</a>. 
      Once you've set up your account and you're ready to upload your package to PyPI 
      (e.g., after you have updated the generated template README.md file to your liking), run the following command:
    </p>
    <code>
      pypimaker upload
    </code>
    <p>
      You will be asked to enter your PyPI username and password (which you've registered previously) in the terminal. 
      Your project will then be uploaded to PyPI, and others can download it using the following command:
    </p>
    <code>
      pip install &lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
      <i>
        (Here, <code>&lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;</code> is the name you selected when running pypimaker generate.)
      </i>
    </p>
    <h3>
      Resetting Your Project
    </h3>
    <p>
      At any time, all of the files generated by PyPI Maker can be removed with the following command:
    </p>
    <code>
      pypimaker reset
    </code>
    <h3>
      Making changes to your PyPI project
    </h3>
    <p>
      To make changes and update your project, simply re-run <code>pypimaker upload</code>. 
      Follow the steps in the terminal to incremement your version number and your update will be pushed to PyPI.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        Note: the extraneous +[CATransaction synchronize] output in the terminal window is a known bug in macOS 13 
        that will not affect your project.
      </i>
