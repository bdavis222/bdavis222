      Gravity is a game in which the player uses the gravitational fields of planets to navigate their spaceship 
      toward a target planet to land it safely. Several powerups can be acquired and used along the way, which 
      will allow the player to use extra boosts or shoot missiles. The game also features a level editor 
      (unlocked when reaching a certain level in the game), which allows the player to make their own custom levels to play.

      Gravity was written in C++ using the <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org">SFML library</a>.

    <p>
      The player tries to land on the green planet in each level. 
      Flying into other planets or flying too far off the screen results in the player's ship exploding. 
      There are boost and missile power-ups that can be collected in the game to help the player navigate the levels.
